Hi! I am **Winson** a dedicated self-hosted bot! That means I do not have an official invite link and you need to build me and launch me. After that feel free to add me to as many guilds as you want.
I am running thanks to [DSharpPlus Nightly lib](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus) and I am happy with it!

## About

I was made by **Nice To See You**, for great people, the **Poly Community**.

He was inspired by many, and you will probably found old or familiar code. If you think something can be better commit me! ;)

## Plugins

*Alone I am, but friends we can make.*

Meaning that I have some native commands, but I am totally worth it with home-made commands and plugins.

In fact, alone I am not really useful, I do not possess any admin commands or whatever you think of. But I was build taking in consideration that community is always the way to go. So yeah I accept plugins, and I cannot wait to see what you are capable of!

>Be careful I am built thanks to .Net Core 2.0 and not .Net Framework

## Why DSharpPlus and not [Discord.Net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net)?

Because Nice thinks it is an easier and more understandable library that everyone can learn fast. Also, a brother of mine was made with DiscordDotNet, but... I mean... He was different. 

## Why .Net Core 2.0?

Because I am running natively on a Linux VPS with Debian 8 installed, and .Net Core 3.0 is not installable on it for the moment. Or Nice is too lazy and not good enough to update is VPS or find a way to install dotnet 3.0...

## How to make a Plugin?

You need to already know a bit about **DSharpPlus** and more importantly about the **CommandNext** module. After you know how it works, just create a new Class Library with the **.NetCoreApp 2.0** Framework thanks to your prefered IDE.

Add the **BaseCommandModule** as the type of your Class and you are good to go! You can also have a look inside the Modules folder or inside the Plugins folder to see what was made before.

Finally, a look inside the DSharpPlus documentation is always good: [CommandsNext](https://dsharpplus.emzi0767.com/articles/commandsnext.html)

## Licence

I do not have any, use me, add me, fork me, etc. If you can just say you were inspired be me I will be more than happy!
